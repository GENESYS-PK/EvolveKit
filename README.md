**EvolveKit** is an upcoming Python library designed to simplify solving complex optimization problems using evolutionary algorithms. Please note that EvolveKit is currently under active development
and has not yet been released under an open-source license.

# :star: Features

* **Simple & Flexible** - easy to use for quick setups, yet fully customizable for advanced control.
* **Supports Heterogeneous Representation** - chromosomes within the same individual can use different gene types.
* **Built-in Statistics** – automatically record key metrics.
* **Inspectors** – log metrics, visualize trends, or halt evolution with custom callbacks.

# :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

To get started, first clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GENESYS-PK/EvolveKit.git
```

Make sure you're inside the project directory before proceeding.<br>
Next, install all required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# :test_tube: Examples

EvolveKit has many built-in examples. They are stored in `evolvekit/examples` directory. To run a basic example, navigate to the root of the repository and execute:

```bash
python -m evolvekit.examples.basic.main
```

To explore more advanced functionality, run:

```bash
python -m evolvekit.examples.advanced.main
```

# :book: Documentation

To generate documentation first install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

Do changes only in `docs/source/versions/vLatest` folder
(excluding `docs/source/versions/vLatest/code` as it is automatically overwritten by GitHub actions).

To generate code documentation (rst), run from the root of the repository:

```bash    
sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/versions/vLatest/code evolvekit
```

Version code is arbitrary sting, as in passing it in a command
will just create a subfolder containing all the code documentation.
Please do not use any real version name (tag name) as it will conflict with existing folders or possible future versions.
The code docstrings derived rst files for each real version (tag) are automatically generated by GitHub actions.
Then based on those files the HTML documentation is generated.

Any other documentation (user guides, tutorials, etc.) should NOT be placed in `docs/source/versions/vLatest/code` folder directly
but somewhere else under `docs/source/versions/vLatest` and link it in `index.rst`.
This way additional documentation can be tracked in the same files for multiple versions (tags) and only after
the tag is created the corresponding rst files will be bundled together under a specific version (tag) folder by GitHub actions.
Once they are bundled, they should not be changed anymore.

Only link files from `docs/source/versions/vLatest` folder in `index.rst`.

To build the HTML documentation, run from the root of the repository:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build/html/versions/vLatest
```
